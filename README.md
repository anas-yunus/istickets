<h2>isTickets()</h2>

isTickets() is a decentralized ticketing system built on blockchain technology. It aims to solve the problem of counterfeit tickets and ticket scalping by providing a secure and transparent platformfor ticket transactions. With isTicket(), event organizers can mint unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing tickets, which are then securely stored on the blockchain. This ensures that each ticket is authentic and cannot be duplicated or tampered with. Additionally, TicketChain allows for seamless ticket transfers and verifications, providing a hassle-free experience for both event organizers and attendees.
